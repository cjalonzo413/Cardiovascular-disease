# Cardiovascular-disease

Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death globally. It is therefore necessary to identify the causes and develop a system to predict heart attacks in an effective manner. The data below has the information about the factors that might have an impact on cardiovascular health.

My first machine learning project using EDA to compare the target vs the different variables

Built a baseline model to predict the risk of a heart attack using a logistic regression and random forest and explore the results while using correlation analysis and logistic regression (leveraging standard error and p-values from statsmodels) for feature selection
